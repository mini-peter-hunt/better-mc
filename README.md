# Better Crafting

Inspirating recipes and tags that change Minecraft!

Inspired by [Vanilla Tweaks](http://vanillatweaks.net/) and
[Quark](https://quark.vazkii.net/)

## Installation

The data pack in the project itself is generated with the default and
recommended options, but to customize your data pack, use the following
instructions:

To generate the full content, use the following command:

```
python3 make.py
```

You can adjust the `options.txt` to configure the content to generate

And to delete the generated content, use the following command:

```
python3 clean.py
```

Add this data pack to an existing world:

- Go to your `.minecraft` folder, go to `saves` and enter the world you want
  this data pack to be installed.
- Go to `datapacks` and copy the `better-crafting` folder inside the project
  folder into the `datapacks`
- Run the game and use the command `/reload` to load the added data packs.

Or generate a world with this data pack. (started from 1.16 Pre-release 1)

Please note that the data pack itself which Minecraft uses is the `better-craft`
inside this folder.

This project requires Python 3.6+

## More ingredients

For more options in the style of this data pack, here's some things you can try:

- Modify some gamerule:
- - Set `doFireTick` to `false`
- - Set `doWeatherCycle` to `false`
- - Set `keepInventory` to `true`
- - Set `mobGriefing` to `false`
- - Set `randomTickSpeed` to `300`
- Use [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads) (this should be well-known, but
  just to be sure)
- Use [Faithful](https://faithful.team/)
- Use [Vanilla Tweaks](http://vanillatweaks.net/)
- Use [Quark](https://quark.vazkii.net/)

## Current State

The features that are currently implemented are as follows:

- Mend everything in the players' inventory and make them unbreakable
  (`unbreakableItem`)
- Make productions (slabs and stairs) smeltable and "vineable" (if has the
  original recipe) (`smeltableProducts` and `vineableProducts`)
- Make tools and armor pieces cheaply upgradable using a smithing table
  (wooden/leather -> iron -> diamond) (`upgradableTools`)
- Make some of the crafting products "decraftable". (`decraftableProducts`)
- Implement some of the recipes to be shapeless, which can fit in the 2x2
  crafting in the player's inventory (`shapelessRecipes`)
- Make saplings, mushroom and fungus craftable from corresponding blocks at 1:1
  ratio (`craftableSaplings`)
- Make ores crafting from mineral and corresponding stone (`craftableOres`)
- Make mineral craftable from surrounding ores with a piece of coal in the
  crafting table, result in no experience but double mineral loot
  (`betterSmeltingOres`)

## Known Issues

- All MCFunction files aren't working
- Mending a tool and making it unbreakable removes all NBT tags but
  `Unbreakable`
- Cleaning the content with the file opened that should be cleaned might
  duplicate the file, which could cause duplication in the recipe book
